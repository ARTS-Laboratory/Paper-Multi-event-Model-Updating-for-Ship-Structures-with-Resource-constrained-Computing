## Introduction:
This project is under the Digital Twin umbrealla that specifically focuses on the “Automatic fusing of data with models", which simply put, the FEA model is automatically updated based on the output data of n constructed models. The importance and implementation is focused on reducing impacts and fatigue damage to ship components as its occurs while optimally utlizing and reconﬁguring the limited computational resources the ship has to offer. A simple example of optimally using the limited computational resources is when a ship experiences an impact (explosion, large wave load, collision etc.) and the computational reources are reconfigured to only calculate conditions of high importance such as remaining ship life and impact detection. Based on these calculated conditions actionable decisions are automatically made that include the closing of hatches and doors to reduce ship flooding and the relocation of machinary that is near the impact location. 

## FEA:
The FEA model is a “Smart Beam”, which is just a connection inside a ship. Some examples this can represent are a truss support connection, a section of the ship hull or a support beam. This beam tracks foreground and background changes such as impacts and cracks caused by fatigue.
